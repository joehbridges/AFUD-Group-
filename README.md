Project deliverables:

1. Scraper code
2. Which 10 brands you chose – provide the frequency table
3. Show all lift values in a table.
4. MDS map
5. State the 5 attributes you chose (again, a frequency table is good here).
6. For task F, provide all details of your analysis – e.g., how you measured “aspirational” and how
you found the most aspirational brand.
7. Advice/insights based on your analysis for your client.
